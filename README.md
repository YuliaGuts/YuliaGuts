## About me
I am a passionate entry-level specialist with a perfect command of English who wants to grow as a Testing Engineer. I worked in a multi-cultural and demanding atmosphere where I exceled at handling multiple time-sensitive tasks and assured quality of the documentation I was in charge of. I have successfully completed Software Testing course and completed an internship in QA I have gained first-hand experience on the basics of SDLC and testing and now am keen to expand my knowledge.
